                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and
                        the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                        JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of
                        your
                        UI using React components:

                        You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work
                        in
                        React Native.

                        React Native runs on <span class="underline"> React</span>, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text_container_two">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="text_container_three"><span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this
                        introduction to React uses cats in its
                        examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    <p class="text_container_four"><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a
                        syntax that lets you write
                        elements inside JavaScript
                        like so: <br><span class="bg">&lt;Te—Öt&gt Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt.</span></p>
                    <p> The React docs have<span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to
                            JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more.
                        Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                            class="bg">name</span> for
                        the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="bg">&lt;Text &gt</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text_container_five"><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text_container_six"><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as
                        arguments you use to configure
                        how components render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                        changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
                        memory!</p>

                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                            class="italic">onChangeText</span>
                        prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
                        that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text_container_eigth">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
                        their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
                        So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
